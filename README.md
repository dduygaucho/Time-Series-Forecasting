**Time series forecasting** is a technique to predict a response variable over a period of time based on historical data. It plays a vital role in many domains, ranging from financial and quantitative trading to air quality prediction of pollutants - PM2.5.

This paper focuses on a multivariate time series forecasting algorithm for air quality performed on **Beijing Air Quality Dataset** by using machine learning and deep learning models. More importantly, this paper also implements multivariate **N-BEATS** architecture - a state-of-the-art model, which is a pure neural network that beats Sequence to Sequence(seq2seq) models such as ES-RNN in its original paper.

**Keywords:** multivariate time series forecasting, N-BEATS, deep learning models
